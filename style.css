/* Theme Name: wp-webpack__change */

/**
 * This is the example style.css. wp-webpack doesn't use this file.
 * It is still required by the Wordpress to read the config of your theme.
 *
 *
 * Why wp-webpack doesn't save output CSS file here?
 *
 * The most obvious answer is that you might decide to bundle your CSS
 * separately. Another thing is that copying configuration headers
 * to minified styles requires additional Wordpress steps
 * in the built process. It slows development and makes it messier.
